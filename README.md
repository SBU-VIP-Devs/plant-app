# Sprout:
An app designed for gardening groups to delegate tasks and keep track of volunteer work!

This project is currently being worked on by Jamie Calub, Hannah Ninan, Susan Qu, and Jasmine Ngo 
in collaboration with the Stony Brook Community Garden. 

Here is a demo of the current functionalities
- Google sign-in + Email sign-in
- Upload garden posts
- If one is the creator of a garden, they can upload tasks within that 
garden under "Garden Settings" and non-admin can view and sign up for tasks
under "Garden Details"
- Profile screen design

The app is currently a work in progress, and we're having fun learning a lot about mobile development for the first time :)

Current work
- Hardware integration (using hydration sensors and pH sensors to send real time data to the app about garden conditions)
- Personal user to-do list (so users can see what they've signed up for)
- Hour tracking and reward system (keep track of numbers of hours volunteered)

We will keep this page updated with progress, so feel free to check back!
